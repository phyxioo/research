Study Design<br><br>
This qualitative study employed an experimental approach to assess the acceptability of using banana peel, pineapple rind, and mango skin in making edible straws, focusing on appearance, taste, aroma, and texture. The participants were three parents who provided opinions through direct interviews and a checklist evaluation. The study involved preparing the edible straws using specific recipes and procedures that included boiling, drying, blending, mixing with ingredients like cassava starch, tylose powder, egg whites, and baking soda, then molding and baking the mixture. Different variations were made, such as banana cassava, banana tylose, mango tylose, mango cassava, pineapple tylose, and pineapple cassava. Ethical considerations included informed consent and maintaining confidentiality. Overall, the findings suggest that the fruit skins used are acceptable for making edible straws.
