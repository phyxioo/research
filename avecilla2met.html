<b>RESEARCH DESIGN</b><br>
This experimental, quantitative study investigates the potential of Aloe vera extract as a natural growth enhancer for red onions in a hydroponic system by measuring its effect on specific growth parameters—such as bulb size, root length, and leaf development—under strictly controlled environmental conditions.
<b><br><br>METHODS</b><br>
Input: <br>
• Ten (10) clear cups, 16 ounces (oz) of water<br> 
• Aloe vera extract, 5.30 grams (g) per cup<br>
• Spoon <br>
• Weighing Scale<br>
• Measuring Tape<br>
• Ten (10) uniformly sized red onion bulbs<br>
• Ten (10) thin sticks<br>
• Direct Sunlight<br>
<br><br>
Process: <br>
1. Collection and Completion of necessary/needed materials<br>
2. Setting up the experiment.<br>
3. Planting, Growing, and Treatment Applying for Red onion<br>
4. Observing, measuring, recording, and monitoring of red onions

Output: A more enhanced growth and development of the Red onion with help of the aloe vera extract.
