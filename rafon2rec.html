<p>⋆˚𝜗ৎ˚⋆ RECOMMENDATION<br><br>
The study recommends that local authorities focus on monitoring and managing slow-flowing sections of the Marikina River, as these areas are most prone to janitor fish nesting and erosion. Reinforcing riverbanks through vegetation planting or bioengineering methods can help stabilize soil and reduce burrow formation. Community awareness programs are also advised to discourage the release of aquarium janitor fish into rivers, limiting the spread of this invasive species. Additionally, future research should examine seasonal nesting patterns and the combined influence of soil type and flow velocity to better understand the ecological impacts of janitor fish.
