<p>⋆˚𝜗ৎ˚⋆ RESULTS<br><br>
The study found that drinking cold water at 0.1°C helped adolescents maintain thermoregulation and homeostasis under heat stress (39–45°C). Smaller volumes (150 mL) offered limited stabilization, while larger amounts (200–250 mL) consistently improved balance, showing a clear dose-dependent effect. Overall, at least 200 mL was identified as the optimal intake for sustaining equilibrium in hot environments.
