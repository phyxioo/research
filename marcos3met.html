<p>⋆˚𝜗ৎ˚⋆ METHODOLOGY<br><br> This study will employ an experimental quantitative research design to assess the potential of bioplastics made from cassava starch and chitosan as an alternative to conventional plastics. The proposed experiment aims to measure the durability, water resistance, and biodegradability of the bioplastic samples that will be produced. This design is considered appropriate since it will allow the researchers to gather measurable, numerical data that can be analyzed statistically to determine the physical and environmental performance of the bioplastic.
