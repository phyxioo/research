<p>⋆˚𝜗ৎ˚⋆ STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br><br>
1. What are the mean baseline room temperature and core body temperature of the adolescent participants prior to the experimental interventions?
<br><br>2. What is the net change in core body temperature of the adolescent participants following the experimental interventions?
<br><br>3. How long does the cooling effect of ingesting cold water persist in maintaining core body temperature within a safe range in a hot environment (39-45°C)?
