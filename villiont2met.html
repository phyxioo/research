<b>Materials:</b> Sieve, Spray bottle, Saucepan, Container, Gloves, Thermometer, Graduated cylinder, Scissors, Weighing scale, 150 grams of Dalandan peels (not crushed), 150 grams of Dalandan peels (crush), 300ml water for each, and15 Alive cockroaches for each trial.<br><br>


<b>Process:</b> Peel the dalandan fruits, Separate the peels into two equal mass using a weighing scale (one is crushed while one is not) using graduated cylinder measure 300ml water to cover the 150g of dalandan fruit 2:1 ratio, Put in a saucepan and bring to a boil, Let it cool down, Put in a container, Let it sit for 2-3 weeks, Remove the huge parts using sieve, and Pour in a spray bottle.<br><br>

<b>Instruments:</b> This study utilizes a quantitative observational approach to investigate the effects of Dalandan peel spray on cockroach responsiveness, comparing intact and crushed peels. A spray solution will be prepared, measuring the volume accurately using a graduated cylinder and weighing the peels. Findings will be documented in a detailed data table to analyze the concentration of Dalandan peel extract and its impact on cockroach behavior, aiming to identify the most effective formulation for use as an insecticide.<br><br>

<b>Experimental Design:</b> This study examines the experimental procedure for extracting limonene from Dalandan peels and its efficacy in repelling cockroaches. Two samples will be prepared: one with pounded peels in 100ml warm water, and another with peels left intact in warm water. The resulting mixtures aim to create a scent that deters cockroaches. An observation chamber will be used, treated with the solution and covered to restrict cockroach hiding. Researchers will assess the distance cockroaches retreat from the scent, measuring escape time and counting departures over five trials with 15 cockroaches each. Data on mean distances and escape times will be analyzed using Excel and manual calculations, culminating in graphical representations for conclusion drawing.
