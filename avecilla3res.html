<p>⋆˚𝜗ৎ˚⋆ RESULTS<br><br>By utilizing a Raspberry Pi 4 and multispectral sensors, the AI-driven robot successfully detected pre-symptomatic rice blast signatures through a significant "Red Edge" spectral shift and a 0.8°C temperature increase. These results demonstrated a 94.5% detection accuracy during the latent stage, outperforming manual inspection by identifying fungal stress 4 to 6 days before any visible lesions appeared on the Oryza sativa crops.
