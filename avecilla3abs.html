<p>⋆˚𝜗ৎ˚⋆ ABSTRACT<br><br>In the Philippines, particularly in Marikina City, the stability of rice (Oryza sativa) production is essential for national food security, yet data from the PSA and DOST-PCAARRD show a 5.5% production drop in early 2024 that triggered a 26% price surge and a declared food security emergency. This supply deficit is often exacerbated by Rice Blast, a fungal disease caused by Magnaporthe oryzae that can result in total yield loss, yet current detection remains limited to manual inspections that identify infections only after significant progression. To bridge this critical gap, this study proposes an innovative, AI-guided photonic sensor robot designed for the early detection of Rice Blast, offering a technological solution to mitigate crop loss and stabilize the national rice supply.
