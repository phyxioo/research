<p>⋆˚𝜗ৎ˚⋆ STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br><br> This study seeks to address the problem of plastic pollution in Marikina City by determining whether cassava starch–chitosan bioplastics can serve as a sustainable alternative to conventional plastics. Specifically, it investigates whether the addition of Manila Bay–derived chitosan improves the durability, water resistance, and biodegradability of cassava starch-based bioplastics, and whether these properties differ significantly from those of traditional plastics.
