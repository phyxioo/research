The study tests how different amounts of cold water (150–250 mL at 0.1°C) affect adolescents’ thermoregulation under heat stress (39–45°C). Using a controlled chamber and within-subjects design, physiological responses like body temperature and sweat rate are measured before and after intake. Data will be analyzed with repeated-measures ANOVA and correlations to identify optimal hydration strategies, with strict safety protocols in place.
