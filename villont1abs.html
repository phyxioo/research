<p>⋆˚𝜗ৎ˚⋆ ABSTRACT<br><br> In the Philippines, commercial scented candles are known to emit harmful chemicals into the atmosphere. This research aims to offer a more organic alternative that does not adversely affect the environment. It draws on literature reviews, existing government documents, and global articles. The study highlights that benzene, a volatile substance prevalent in various industrial products, can cause serious health effects such as cancer. Furthermore, burning paraffin wax candles releases benzene and toluene, as well as soot and particulates that contribute to respiratory issues. A 2021 FDA safety alert warned against the use of certain candle products due to toxic levels of benzene and lead-cored wicks, particularly endangering young children. The researchers seek solutions to mitigate air pollution and its effects on public health.
