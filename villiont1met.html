<b>Research Design:</b> Identified as quantitative, focusing on the effects of scented candles and their therapeutic benefits. <br><br>

<b>Participants:</b> Grade 7 STE Wisdom Students of Sta. Elena High School will test the innovation. <br><br>

<b>Materials/Equipment:</b><br>

<b>Input Variables:</b><br>
• Independent: Ingredients, comparison of beeswax vs paraffin.<br>
• Dependent: Burn time.<br>
• Control: Candle dimensions, wick length.<br>
<br>
<b>Process:</b><br>
1. Essential Oil Extraction: Solvent extraction method to preserve natural properties and therapeutic effects.<br>
2. Wax Preparation: Beeswax is melted using a double boiler at 185°F, combined with essential oils, and cooled to 125°F.<br>
3. Candle Making: Infused wax poured into a mold with a wick and allowed to cool to complete the candle.<br>
