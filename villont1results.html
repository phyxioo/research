<p>⋆˚𝜗ৎ˚⋆ RESULTS<br><br>The results show that the candles have varying burn times, ranging from about 3 to 10 hours, influenced by wick length and thickness, with some wax melting easily. Most respondents (75%) enjoyed the candle’s scent, describing it as strong and pleasant, though a few noted weak or no scent, possibly due to uneven fragrance distribution during production. The candles were visually appealing, with smooth surfaces and no deformities, though smaller than commercial candles because of the molds used. Durability differed by candle type: lemongrass candles burned the longest, sampaguita candles were softer and melted easily, and rose candles received mixed feedback. Overall, users reported a positive experience, noting the candles’ calming atmosphere, steady flame, pleasant fragrance, and ability to promote relaxation, cheerfulness, and better sleep.
