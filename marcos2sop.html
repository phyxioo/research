<p>⋆˚𝜗ৎ˚⋆ STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM<br><br> The introduction of janitor fish (Pterygoplichthys disjunctivus) into Philippine waterways has backfired, as the species multiplied unchecked in the absence of natural predators. Rather than improving water quality, it has severely disrupted ecosystems by outcompeting native fish, consuming their eggs, uprooting aquatic plants, and destabilizing food chains. In critical areas such as Laguna de Bay and the Marikina River, janitor fish have overtaken native populations, leading to biodiversity loss and damaging local fisheries. Despite ongoing control measures like harvesting and exploring alternative uses, their numbers continue to rise, underscoring the ecological risks of introducing non-native species without thorough scientific evaluation.
