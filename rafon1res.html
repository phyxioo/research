<p>⋆˚𝜗ৎ˚⋆ RESULTS<br><br>
The results of the study revealed that drainage water samples collected from areas of the Marikina Public Market contained high levels of microbial contamination, with E. coli concentrations averaging 1.5 × 10⁵ CFU/100 mL and Leptospira detected in more than half of the samples. These values significantly exceeded DENR‑EMB safety thresholds, and contamination was notably higher in sites with visible rat activity. Replicated trials confirmed the consistency of findings, indicating that the market’s drainage system poses a considerable health risk to vendors and consumers, thereby underscoring the urgent need for improved sanitation and monitoring strategies.
