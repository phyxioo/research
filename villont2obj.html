<p>⋆˚𝜗ৎ˚⋆ OBJECTIVES<br><br>This study aims to investigate the effectiveness of crushed and sprayed dalandan (Citrus aurantium) peels in repelling cockroaches. We will compare the efficacy of these two methods to determine which one is more effective in reducing cockroach activity. The study may also explore other factors such as the duration of repellency, the impact of different concentrations, and the specific chemical compounds responsible for the insecticide for cockroaches.
