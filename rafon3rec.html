The study was limited to adolescents and examined only water volume at a constant temperature, with clothing treated as an extraneous factor. Future research should consider the effects of attire, include broader age groups, test different water temperatures, and explore diverse climates and physical activities. These directions aim to expand understanding of hydration and thermoregulation across varied conditions and populations.
