<p>⋆˚𝜗ৎ˚⋆ ABSTRACT<br><br>This study investigates the influence of river flow velocity on the nesting patterns of janitor fish (Pterygoplichthys spp.) along the Marikina River banks. As an invasive species, janitor fish pose ecological and structural threats due to their burrowing behavior, which destabilizes soil and accelerates erosion. Using an experimental research design, the study compares nest distribution, frequency, and stability across river sections characterized by slow, moderate, and fast flow velocities, while also considering soil type, bank slope, and vegetation. Findings are expected to show that nests are more abundant and stable in slow-moving waters, with fewer and less persistent nests in faster currents. By identifying flow conditions that favor nesting, the research aims to provide insights for riverbank management, erosion prevention, and invasive species control, ultimately contributing to the preservation of the Marikina River ecosystem and the protection of surrounding communities.
