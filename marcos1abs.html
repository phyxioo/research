<p>⋆˚𝜗ৎ˚⋆ ABSTRACT<br><br>Plastic waste pollution is a serious global and local problem caused by the weaknesses of existing waste management systems and the increasing consumption of plastic driven by population growth. Millions of tons of plastic waste enter oceans, rivers, and lakes every year, causing severe environmental damage. The Philippines is among the countries with the highest plastic waste leakage into marine ecosystems, producing about 2.7 million tons of plastic waste annually, with a significant portion reaching bodies of water. This situation threatens coastal communities and key industries such as fishing and tourism. Researchers recognize plastic waste as a widespread issue affecting daily life, motivating the search for sustainable and eco-friendly alternatives.<br><br>

One promising solution is the utilization of fruit peels, which are often discarded as waste despite being rich in nutrients and bioactive compounds. Mango peels contain fiber and antioxidants with cytoprotective and antiproliferative properties. Pineapple rinds are rich in phenolic compounds such as ferulic acid and have applications in food, cosmetics, composting, and mushroom cultivation. Banana peels are abundant in minerals, antioxidants, dietary fiber, and bioactive compounds and show strong potential for commercial use, including water pollutant biosorption.<br><br>

Studies indicate that fruit peels are safe when properly prepared and measured and can be used to develop value-added products such as tea, fertilizers, skincare products, and organic supplements. Proper utilization of fruit peels not only reduces organic waste but also offers sustainable alternatives that can help address environmental pollution while providing nutritional, economic, and socio-environmental benefits.
