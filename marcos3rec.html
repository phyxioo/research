<p>⋆˚𝜗ৎ˚⋆ RECOMMENDATION<br><br> The study recommends further development of cassava starch–chitosan bioplastics for use in single-use items such as packaging, bags, and disposable food containers. Optimization of formulation ratios and processing techniques is advised to further enhance durability and water resistance. Larger-scale testing and real-world application trials are recommended to validate laboratory findings. Local government units and environmental agencies are encouraged to support pilot production programs to reduce plastic waste and promote sustainable materials. Public awareness campaigns highlighting the environmental benefits of bioplastics should be conducted to increase community acceptance, while collaboration with local farmers and fisheries is recommended to strengthen local resource utilization and support a circular economy.
