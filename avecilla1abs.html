<p>⋆˚𝜗ৎ˚⋆ ABSTRACT<br><br>Water pollution and scarcity represent a critical global crisis, with only 73% of the world's population accessing safely managed drinking water. Billions remain at risk of life-threatening waterborne diseases, such as cholera and typhoid, due to inadequate sanitation and data gaps in water quality. In the Philippines, significant regional inequalities persist; approximately three million Filipinos rely on unsafe water sources, while vital ecosystems face threats as biodiversity hotspots. This study examines the localized impact of this crisis in Marikina City, where residents face visible pollution in the Marikina River and inconsistent domestic water quality. By highlighting the initiatives of Clean Water International and the firsthand observations of student researchers, this paper emphasizes the urgent need for infrastructure development—including household water connections and treatment systems—to mitigate health risks and ensure equitable access to clean water.
