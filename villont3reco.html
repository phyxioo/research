<p>⋆˚𝜗ৎ˚⋆ RECOMMENDATIONS<br><br>This study reveals important gaps in our understanding of vegetable growth performance. To facilitate further research and extend this investigation, two key recommendations are proposed:<br><br>

Increase water supply: Utilizing a larger volume of water can enhance soil development and prevent rapid drying, as observed in the researchers' findings concerning soil moisture levels.<br><br>

Ensure adequate sunlight: Despite sunlight levels being consistent during the experiment, prolonged exposure could not be maintained due to weather changes, indicating a need for better sunlight management in similar studies.
