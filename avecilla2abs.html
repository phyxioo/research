<p>⋆˚𝜗ৎ˚⋆ ABSTRACT<br><br>In response to the unprecedented price hikes and supply shortages of red onions in the Philippines, this research investigates the use of Aloe vera extract as a natural biostimulant to enhance the growth and quality of Allium cepa within a sustainable hydroponic system. While traditional agriculture struggles with market instability, this study aims to fill a significant research gap by evaluating how varying concentrations of Aloe vera influence key development parameters—such as root length, bulb size, and foliar health—in a soilless environment. By optimizing these growth factors, the study seeks to establish a scalable, eco-friendly methodology that improves crop yields, stabilizes market prices, and contributes to long-term food security and economic relief for Filipino consumers and producers.
