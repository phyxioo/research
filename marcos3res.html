<p>⋆˚𝜗ৎ˚⋆ RESULTS<br><br> The results showed that cassava starch–chitosan bioplastics performed better than starch-only bioplastics, with mechanical tests confirming higher tensile strength and flexibility that made them more durable for light-use applications. Water resistance improved as chitosan reduced moisture absorption and helped the bioplastics maintain their structure, though they remained less resistant than conventional plastics. Biodegradability tests revealed that cassava starch–chitosan bioplastics decomposed significantly faster than traditional plastics under soil conditions, highlighting their environmental advantage. Community surveys further indicated positive acceptance, especially when respondents learned the materials were locally sourced and biodegradable. Overall, the findings confirm that cassava starch–chitosan bioplastics are a functional, eco-friendly, and locally feasible alternative to conventional plastics for selected applications in Marikina City.
