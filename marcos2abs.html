<p>⋆˚𝜗ৎ˚⋆ ABSTRACT<br><br> The study found that janitor fish skin (Pterygoplichthys disjunctivus) can serve as a viable and sustainable alternative to traditional leather, showing comparable durability and water resistance in standardized laboratory tests. By repurposing an invasive species that threatens ecosystems in the Philippines, particularly the Marikina River, the research demonstrates how environmental challenges can be transformed into opportunities for sustainable material development. Survey results further revealed positive public perception and acceptance of fish leather, reinforcing its potential for integration into the leather industry. Overall, the findings highlight that utilizing janitor fish skin not only supports eco-friendly production but also contributes to waste reduction, invasive species management, and the advancement of a circular economy.
