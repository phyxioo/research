The research examined how cold water intake influences thermoregulation in adolescents, a group vulnerable to heat-related illnesses due to climate change. Involving 5–10 participants aged 13–14, the experiment placed them in a controlled room environment where each consumed varying volumes and temperatures of water. Measurements showed differences in thermoregulation among those who drank 100 mL at 11°C, 200 mL at 15°C, and 300 mL at 18°C. Results confirmed that cold water consumption affects adolescents’ ability to regulate body temperature, highlighting its potential role in mitigating heat stress.
