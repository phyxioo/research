<b>Research Design:</b><br>The study uses an experimental design to investigate how river flow velocity affects the nesting behavior of janitor fish <i>(Pterygoplichthys spp.)</i> in the Marikina River. Sites with slow, moderate, and fast flows will be compared in terms of nest distribution, frequency, and stability. Data collection includes water speed, nest counts, and nest persistence, alongside environmental factors like soil type, bank slope, and vegetation to ensure accurate comparisons.
<br><br>
<b>Materials and Equipment:</b><br> Fieldwork will employ GPS or smartphones for mapping, cameras for documentation, flow meters or floating objects to measure water velocity, notebooks and pens for recording, and measuring tapes for nest dimensions. To protect researchers from waterborne hazards and pollutants, personal protective equipment such as face masks, goggles, rubber gloves, and boots will be used.
