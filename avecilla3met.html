<b>RESEARCH DESIGN</b><br>
This study employs a quantitative design using developmental and comparative experimental approaches to build an AI-powered photonic sensor robot using Raspberry Pi 4, subsequently evaluating its accuracy and time efficiency against manual inspections by rice growers in Marikina City through statistical analysis in Microsoft Excel and SPSS.
<br><br><b>PARTICIPANTS</b><br>
By integrating AI and photonic sensors, this research directly empowers farmers and producers to secure their livelihoods by reducing crop losses from diseases by 20–40%, while simultaneously providing consumers with more affordable, high-quality rice through a stabilized food system. Furthermore, it offers government policymakers a scientific framework for building robust biosecurity regulations and provides future scholars with a deeper foundation in pathogen biology and sustainable agriculture to benefit generations to come.
<br><br><b>MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENTS</b><br>
To conduct this research, Oryza sativa 
crops—including both healthy and infected specimens—will be analyzed using 
an AI-Driven Photonic Sensor Robot to detect spectral and color variations indicative of rice blast. Preparation involves cleaning leaves with distilled water and an absorbent cloth to ensure accurate sensor readings, while safety and assembly are managed with gloves. The system is powered by a stable electrical supply and controlled via a laptop interface for real-time data recording and analysis.
<br><br><b>METHODS<br></b>
This project involves assembling a Photonic Sensor Robot using a Raspberry Pi 4 with cooling, a stable power system, camera and multispectral sensors, optical controls, communication modules, and structural support. The setup is programmed with Python, OpenCV, NumPy, and TensorFlow to process captured data, while careful wiring, mounting, and environmental preparation ensure smooth operation. Once executed, the system provides early detection of rice blast disease (Magnaporthe grisea) in rice crops, delivering accurate information when directed at the plants.
