<p>⋆˚𝜗ৎ˚⋆ METHODOLOGY<br><br> The study tested janitor fish skin (Pterygoplichthys disjunctivus) as an alternative to traditional leather, using controlled preparation and standardized laboratory methods. Results showed that fish skin demonstrated comparable durability, flexibility, and resistance to wear, with statistical analysis confirming its viability. Overall, the findings highlight its potential as a sustainable material that reduces waste, manages invasive species, and supports eco-friendly innovation in industries like fashion.
