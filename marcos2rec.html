<p>⋆˚𝜗ৎ˚⋆ RECOMMENDATION<br><br>This study recommends janitor fish skin leather proved to be a viable alternative to traditional leather, showing comparable durability, flexibility, and resistance to wear despite slightly lower tensile strength. It absorbed more moisture but dried faster while maintaining its structure, making it suitable for light to medium-duty applications. Beyond performance, its use offers clear sustainability benefits by reducing waste and managing invasive species, with public perception largely supportive once environmental advantages are highlighted. Overall, the findings confirm its potential as an eco-friendly material for selected leather applications.
