<p>⋆˚𝜗ৎ˚⋆ ABSTRACT<br><br>This study investigates microbial contamination in drainage water from rat‑infested areas of the 
Marikina Public Market, focusing on E. coli and Leptospira as biological indicators. Water samples 
will be collected and analyzed under DENR‑EMB standards to determine if contamination levels 
exceed safety thresholds. Findings aim to guide the Local Government Unit in improving 
sanitation strategies and protecting both vendors and consumers.
