<p>⋆˚𝜗ৎ˚⋆ STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM
<br><br>
  A. How does river flow velocity affect the nesting patterns of janitor fish along the Marikina River banks?
  <br><br>B. In which areas of the river (slow, moderate, fast) are janitor fish nests most commonly found?
  <br><br>C. How does the number of nests differ in areas with different flow velocities?
  <br><br>D. Are nests in fast-flowing areas less stable than those in slow-flowing areas?
