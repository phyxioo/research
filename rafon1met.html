<b>Research Design:</b> Identified as quantitative, focusing on the effects of scented candles and their therapeutic benefits. <br><br>

<b>Materials:</b><br>
Sterilized specimen containers (100 mL) will be used to collect drainage water samples suspected of contamination. Each container will be secured inside a zip lock bag to prevent spillage and stored in a rectangular clear case for safe transport. The collected drainage water serves as the primary material for laboratory testing of E. coli and Leptospira.
<br><br>
<b>Equipments:</b>Researchers will wear personal protective equipment (PPE), including face masks, latex gloves, medical goggles, and hair nets, to ensure safety during sample collection and prevent contamination of specimens. These protective tools safeguard against pathogens present in the drainage system while maintaining the integrity of the samples.
