<p>⋆˚𝜗ৎ˚⋆ ABSTRACT<br><br> The study examines cassava starch–chitosan bioplastics as a sustainable alternative to conventional plastics to help address plastic pollution in Marikina City. It evaluates the bioplastics’ durability, water resistance, and biodegradability using an experimental quantitative approach, alongside surveys to assess community acceptance. The research proposes that adding Manila Bay–derived chitosan significantly improves these properties compared to traditional plastics. Although limited to laboratory-scale testing, the study emphasizes the potential of locally sourced bioplastics to reduce plastic waste, support local livelihoods, and promote sustainable urban development in Marikina City.
