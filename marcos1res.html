<p>⋆˚𝜗ৎ˚⋆ RESULTS<br><br>Based on the researcher's survey, Mango skin, Banana Peel, and Pineapple rind are acceptable in making edible straw but they have differences when it comes to appearance, taste, aroma, color, and performance. Among the three fruit skins used, mango has the most positive feedback. But all of the edible straws still need improvement.
