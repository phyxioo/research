<p>⋆˚𝜗ৎ˚⋆ RESULTS<br><br>
Janitor fish nests were observed to be most common and stable in the slow-flowing parts of the Marikina River, where calmer waters allowed burrows to remain intact for longer periods, while in moderately flowing sections nests were fewer and often showed signs of erosion as the steady current gradually weakened their structure, and in fast-flowing areas nests were rare and quickly destroyed by turbulent conditions that prevented long-term maintenance; overall, these findings confirm that river flow is the primary factor shaping nest distribution, with soil type exerting a secondary influence on nest strength and durability.
