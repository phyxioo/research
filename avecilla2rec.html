<p>⋆˚𝜗ৎ˚⋆ RECOMMENDATIONS<br><br>To enhance the reliability and depth of future research, investigators should increase sample sizes and strictly standardize environmental variables like light, temperature, and nutrient concentrations to isolate specific growth effects more accurately. Furthermore, extending the study duration and exploring additional variables—such as pH levels, biochemical composition, and varying Aloe vera extract concentrations—would provide critical insights into long-term sustainability and the optimization of crop quality in hydroponic systems.
