<p>⋆˚𝜗ৎ˚⋆ RESULTS<br><br>While Set Up A (Water only) consistently promoted superior root expansion—evidenced by Onion 2 reaching a root length of 2.15 inches compared to 1 inch in Set Up B(Water w/ Aloe vera extract)—Set Up B conversely excelled in foliar development, characterized by earlier leaf emergence and more vibrant coloration. Despite these divergent growth patterns in roots and leaves, overall bulb development remained remarkably consistent between both groups, with measurements stabilizing at 4 inches in circumference and 2.8 inches in height during the initial study period.
