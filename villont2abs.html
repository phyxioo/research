<p>⋆˚𝜗ৎ˚⋆ ABSTRACT<br><br>Cockroach infestations are a significant household issue, presenting health risks and promoting unsanitary conditions. This research explores the use of discarded dalandan peels (Citrus auratium) as a natural, eco-friendly insecticide alternative to harmful chemical treatments. The study aims to evaluate various preparations of dalandan peels and their effectiveness in repelling cockroaches. By repurposing these peels, the researchers seek to improve household hygiene and manage waste effectively, contributing to public health and environmental conservation. The motivation stems from personal experiences with cockroaches and the desire to utilize an often-discarded resource for pest control.
