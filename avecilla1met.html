<b>RESEARCH DESIGN</b><br></br>
Using a non-experimental quantitative design, this study 
evaluates the effectiveness of low-cost materials like Moringa seeds and 
pebbles in reducing wastewater turbidity through controlled, replicated laboratory filtration trials.
<br></br><b>PARTICIPANTS</b><br>
Marikina City residents will evaluate the performance of  
Moringa-based versus standard water filters by observing wastewater filtration 
and providing feedback via a Likert scale survey to determine the more 
effective system.<br></br>
<b>MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENTS</b><br>
This research utilizes Moringa oleifera seeds, 
mineral beads, and standard filters to treat wastewater, using a pH meter, 
scale, and mortar and pestle to measure and prepare the materials for 
comparative testing.<br><br>
<b>METHODS</b><br><br>
Input: <br>
• Water filter container <br>
• Moringa seeds (Moringa Oleifera) <br>
• Wash Cloth <br>
• Waste water
<br><br>
Process: <br>
1. Prepare your materials and ensure the modality of your environment stays 
constant throughout the experimentation <br>
2. Ensure the cleanliness and dryness of your container and wrap the bottom 
with a washcloth <br>
3. Add an even layer of your Moringa (Moringa Oleifera), leaving enough space 
for the water to flow through <br>
4. Ensure the cleanliness of the water filter.

Output:<br>
Moringa Oleifera Water Filter
